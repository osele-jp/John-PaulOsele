## About My GitHub

Most of my repositories reflect hands-on projects from my coursework and personal experiments, including:

- 🛠️ **Operating Systems projects** – kernel exercises, process management, file systems, and more.  
- 🌐 **Networking tools** – reverse proxies, network scripts, and home server setups.  
<!--- 🤖 **AI/ML experiments** – small models and explorations in machine learning frameworks. -->

I enjoy projects that **combine theory with practical implementation**, allowing me to explore how systems, networks, and algorithms work under the hood.
